             <strong>Rice-based dish </strong> which often also includes ingredients like <em>Chicken and veg</em>. Long-grained rice varieties like basmati are often used to prepare pulaos.<br>
Sometimes the rice and other ingredients are cooked together in spices and broth, while at other times the parboiled rice is mixed with the spices, vegetable or meat mixture and stir-fried together.<br>
You can use any cut of <strong>chicken </strong>for my this recipe but boneless, skinless thighs or breasts are the best. The meat is marinated for only <strong><em>15 minutes</em></strong> while you prepare the other ingredients.
